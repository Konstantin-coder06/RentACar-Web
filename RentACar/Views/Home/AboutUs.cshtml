                    <p>Fast Drive was founded in 2018 with a simple mission: to provide an exceptional car rental experience in Dubai. What began as a small fleet of 10 luxury vehicles has grown into one of the city's most trusted rental services.</p>
                    <p>Our founder, Konstantin Mitkov, noticed a gap in the market for a transparent, customer-focused car rental service. After experiencing frustration with hidden fees and poor customer service from existing providers, he decided to create a company that puts the customer experience first.</p>
                    <p>Today, Fast Drive operates a fleet of over 200 vehicles ranging from economy cars to luxury SUVs and sports cars. We serve thousands of customers each year, from tourists exploring the wonders of Dubai to residents needing reliable transportation for longer periods.</p>
